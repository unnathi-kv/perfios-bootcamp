      "********************\n",
      "\n",
      "The \"str.format()\" method and the \"Formatter\" class share the same\n",
      "syntax for format strings (although in the case of \"Formatter\",\n",
      "subclasses can define their own format string syntax).  The syntax is\n",
      "related to that of formatted string literals, but there are\n",
      "differences.\n",
      "\n",
      "Format strings contain “replacement fields” surrounded by curly braces\n",
      "\"{}\". Anything that is not contained in braces is considered literal\n",
      "text, which is copied unchanged to the output.  If you need to include\n",
      "a brace character in the literal text, it can be escaped by doubling:\n",
      "\"{{\" and \"}}\".\n",
      "\n",
      "The grammar for a replacement field is as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "      replacement_field ::= \"{\" [field_name] [\"!\" conversion] [\":\" format_spec] \"}\"\n",
      "      field_name        ::= arg_name (\".\" attribute_name | \"[\" element_index \"]\")*\n",
      "      arg_name          ::= [identifier | digit+]\n",
      "      attribute_name    ::= identifier\n",
      "      element_index     ::= digit+ | index_string\n",
      "      index_string      ::= <any source character except \"]\"> +\n",
      "      conversion        ::= \"r\" | \"s\" | \"a\"\n",
      "      format_spec       ::= <described in the next section>\n",
      "\n",
      "In less formal terms, the replacement field can start with a\n",
      "*field_name* that specifies the object whose value is to be formatted\n",
      "and inserted into the output instead of the replacement field. The\n",
      "*field_name* is optionally followed by a  *conversion* field, which is\n",
      "preceded by an exclamation point \"'!'\", and a *format_spec*, which is\n",
      "preceded by a colon \"':'\".  These specify a non-default format for the\n",
      "replacement value.\n",
      "\n",
      "See also the Format Specification Mini-Language section.\n",
      "\n",
      "The *field_name* itself begins with an *arg_name* that is either a\n",
      "number or a keyword.  If it’s a number, it refers to a positional\n",
      "argument, and if it’s a keyword, it refers to a named keyword\n",
      "argument.  If the numerical arg_names in a format string are 0, 1, 2,\n",
      "… in sequence, they can all be omitted (not just some) and the numbers\n",
      "0, 1, 2, … will be automatically inserted in that order. Because\n",
      "*arg_name* is not quote-delimited, it is not possible to specify\n",
      "arbitrary dictionary keys (e.g., the strings \"'10'\" or \"':-]'\") within\n",
      "a format string. The *arg_name* can be followed by any number of index\n",
      "or attribute expressions. An expression of the form \"'.name'\" selects\n",
      "the named attribute using \"getattr()\", while an expression of the form\n",
      "\"'[index]'\" does an index lookup using \"__getitem__()\".\n",

      "   \"Units destroyed: {players[0]}\"   # First element of keyword argument 'players'.\n",
      "\n",
      "The *conversion* field causes a type coercion before formatting.\n",
      "Normally, the job of formatting a value is done by the \"__format__()\"\n",
      "method of the value itself.  However, in some cases it is desirable to\n",
      "force a type to be formatted as a string, overriding its own\n",
      "definition of formatting.  By converting the value to a string before\n",

      "\n",

      "   \"Harold's a clever {0!s}\"        # Calls str() on the argument first\n",
      "   \"Bring out the holy {name!r}\"    # Calls repr() on the argument first\n",
      "   \"More {!a}\"                      # Calls ascii() on the argument first\n",

      "The *format_spec* field contains a specification of how the value\n",

      "format specification typically modifies the result.\n",
      "\n",
